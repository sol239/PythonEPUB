<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><span class="underline">W</span></span>ith fifteen minutes until the opening of the Sphinx, Father Captain de Soya paces the valley floor. The storm has long since arrived, and sand fills the air in a rasping blizzard. Hundreds of Swiss Guard are deployed here along the Valley floor, but their armored CTVs, their gun emplacements, their missile batteries, their observation posts—all are invisible due to the dust storm. But de Soya knows that they would be invisible at any rate, concealed behind camouflage fields and chameleon polymer. The father-captain has to rely on his infrared to see anything in this howling storm. And even then, with his visor down and sealed, fine particles of sand make their way down his combat suit collar and up into his mouth. This day tastes of grit. His sweat leaves tiny trails of red mud, like blood from some holy stigmata, on his brow and cheeks.</p>
<p class="indent">“Attention,” he says over the all-call channels. “This is Father Captain de Soya, commanding this mission under papal imperative. Commander Barnes-Avne will repeat these orders in a moment, but right now I want to specify that there will be no actions taken, no shots fired, no defensive acts initiated that will in any way endanger the life of the child who will be stepping from one of these tombs in … thirteen and a half minutes. I want this understood by every Pax officer and trooper, every torchship captain and space-navy sailor, every pilot and airborne <a id="page109"/>flight officer … <em>this child must be captured but unharmed</em>. Failure to heed this warning will result in court-martial and summary execution. May we all serve our Lord and our Church this day.… In the name of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I ask that our efforts be successful. Father Captain de Soya, Acting Commander Hyperion expedition, out.”</p>
<p class="indent">He continues walking as the chorus of amens comes in over tactical channels. Suddenly he pauses. “Commander?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, Father Captain.” Barnes-Avne’s voice is calm in his earphones.</p>
<p class="indent">“Would it screw up your perimeter if I asked for Sergeant Gregorius’s squad to join me here at the Sphinx?”</p>
<p class="indent">There is the briefest pause, which tells him how little the ground Commander thinks of such last-minute changes in plans. The “reception committee”—a squad of specially chosen Swiss Guard, the doctor with the sedative ready to be administered, and a medic with the living cruciform in its stasis container—are even now waiting at the foot of the Sphinx’s stairs.</p>
<p class="indent">“Gregorius and his troops will be there in three minutes,” says the Commander. De Soya can hear the commands going out over the tactical tightbeam and the confirmations coming in. Once again he has asked these five men and women to fly in dangerous conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">The squad touches down in two minutes forty-five seconds. De Soya can see them only on infrared; their reaction paks are glowing white-hot.</p>
<p class="indent">“Shed the flying paks,” he says. “Just stay near me no matter what happens. Watch my back.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, sir,” comes Sergeant Gregorius’s rumble through the wind howl. The huge noncom steps closer, his visor and combat suit looming in de Soya’s IR vision. Obviously the sergeant wants a visual confirmation on whose back he is watching.</p>
<p class="indent">“S-minus ten minutes,” says Commander Barnes-Avne. “Sensors indicate unusual activity in the antientropic fields around the tombs.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I feel it,” says de Soya. Indeed, he can. The shifting of the time fields in the Valley creates a sense of vertigo in him not too dissimilar from nausea. Both this and the raging sandstorm make the priest-captain feel unattached to the ground, lightheaded, almost drunk. Planting his feet carefully, de Soya walks <a id="page110"/>back to the Sphinx. Gregorius and his troopers follow in a tight V.</p>
<p class="indent">The “welcoming committee” is standing on the steps of the Sphinx. De Soya approaches, flashes his infrared and radio ID, talks briefly with the doctor carrying the sedative ampule—warns the woman not to harm the child—and then waits. There are thirteen forms on the steps now, counting Gregorius’s team. De Soya realizes that the combat squads do not look especially welcoming with their raised heavy weapons. “Step back a few paces,” he says to the two squad sergeants. “Keep the squads ready, but out of sight in the storm.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Affirmative.” The ten troopers take a dozen steps back and are totally invisible in the blowing sand. De Soya knows that nothing living could break through the perimeter they have established.</p>
<p class="indent">To the doctor and his medic aide carrying the cruciform, De Soya says, “Let’s get closer to the door.” The suited figures nod and the three slowly climb the stairs. The antientropic fields are intense now. De Soya remembers once, as a young boy, he had stood up to his chest in a vicious surf, the tide and undertow trying to pull him out into an unfriendly ocean on his homeworld. This is a bit like that.</p>
<p class="indent">“S-minus seven minutes,” says Barnes-Avne on the common channel. Then, on the tightbeam to de Soya, “Father Captain, would you like the skimmer to land and get you? There’s a better overview up here.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No, thank you,” says de Soya. “I’ll stay with the contact team.” He sees on his display that the skimmer is climbing for altitude, finally pausing at ten thousand meters, above the worst of the dust storm. Like any good commander, Barnes-Avne wants to control the action while not being caught up in it.</p>
<p class="indent">De Soya keys the private channel to his dropship pilot. “Hiroshe?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, sir?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Be ready to lift off in ten minutes or less.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Ready, sir.”</p>
<p class="indent">“The storm won’t be a problem?” As with all deep-space combat captains, de Soya is more distrustful of atmosphere than of almost anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">“No problem, sir.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Good.”</p>
<p class="indent">“S-minus five minutes,” comes Commander Barnes-Avne’s <a id="page111"/>steady voice. “Orbital detectors show no space activity for thirty AUs. Northern hemispheric airwatch shows no vehicles airborne. Ground detection shows no unauthorized movement from the Bridle Range to the coast.”</p>
<p class="indent">“COP screens clear,” comes the C<sup class="frac">3</sup> controller’s voice.</p>
<p class="indent">“CAP clear,” says the lead Scorpion pilot. “It’s still a beautiful day up here.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Radio and tightbeam silence from this point on until Level Six goes to standdown,” says Barnes-Avne. “S-minus four minutes and sensors show maximum antientropic activity throughout the Valley. Contact team, report in.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m at the door,” says Dr. Chatkra.</p>
<p class="indent">“Ready,” says the medic, a very young trooper named Caf. The trooper’s voice is shaky. De Soya realizes that he does not know if Caf is male or female.</p>
<p class="indent">“All set here,” reports de Soya. He glances over his shoulder through the clear visor. Even the bottom of the stone stairway is invisible in the howling sand. Electrical discharges crackle and pop. De Soya switches to IR and sees the ten Swiss Guards standing there, weapons literally hot.</p>
<p class="indent">Even in the midst of storm noise, a terrible quiet suddenly descends. De Soya can hear his own breathing within the helmet of his combat suit. The unused com channels hiss and pop with static. More static lashes his tactical and IR visors, and de Soya slides them up in exasperation. The sealed portal of the Sphinx is less than three meters in front of him, but the sand now conceals it, now reveals it, like a shifting curtain. De Soya takes two steps closer, and Dr. Chatkra and her medic follow.</p>
<p class="indent">“Two minutes,” says Barnes-Avne. “All weapons to full hot. High-speed recorders to automatic. Medical dustoff teams stand by.”</p>
<p class="indent">De Soya closes his eyes to fight the vertigo of the time tides. <em>The universe</em>, he thinks, <em>is truly wondrous</em>. He is sorry that he has to sedate the child within seconds of meeting her. Those are his orders—she would sleep through the attachment of the cruciform and the fatal flight back to Pacem—and he knows that he will, in all probability, never hear the girl’s voice. He is sorry. He would like to talk to her, ask her questions about the past, about herself.</p>
<p class="indent">“One minute. Perimeter fire control on full auto.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Commander!” De Soya has to slide the tactical visor down to identify the voice as belonging to a science lieutenant on the <a id="page112"/>interior perimeter. “The fields are building to max along <em>all</em> the tombs! Doors opening on the caves, the Monolith, the Shrike Palace, the Jade Tomb …”</p>
<p class="indent">“Silence on all channels,” snaps Barnes-Avne. “We’re monitoring it here. Thirty seconds.”</p>
<p class="indent">De Soya realizes that the child is going to step into this new era only to be confronted with three helmeted, visored figures in combat armor, and slides all of his visors up. He may never get to talk to the girl, but she will see his human face before she sleeps.</p>
<p class="indent">“Fifteen seconds.” For the first time de Soya hears tension in the Commander’s voice.</p>
<p class="indent">Blowing sand claws at Father Captain de Soya’s exposed eyes. He raises a gloved hand, rubs, and blinks through tears. He and Dr. Chatkra take another step closer. The doors of the Sphinx are opening inward. The interior is dark. De Soya wishes he could see in IR, but he does not flip the visor down. He is determined that this child will see his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">A shadow moves within darkness. The doctor begins to step toward the form, but de Soya touches her arm. “Wait.”</p>
<p class="indent">The shadow becomes a figure; the figure becomes a form; the form is a child. She is smaller than de Soya expected. Her shoulder-length hair blows in the wind.</p>
<p class="indent">“Aenea,” says de Soya. He had not planned on speaking to her, or calling her by name.</p>
<p class="indent">The girl looks up at him. He sees the dark eyes, but senses no fear there—just … anxiety? Sadness?</p>
<p class="indent">“Aenea, don’t worry …,” he begins, but the doctor moves forward quickly at that moment, injector raised, and the girl takes a quick step back.</p>
<p class="indent">It is then that Father Captain de Soya sees the second figure in the gloom. And it is then that the screaming begins.</p>
