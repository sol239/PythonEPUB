<p class="nonindent"><span class="dropcaps"><span class="underline">F</span></span>ather de Soya is surprised when they finally respond on the common band. He had not thought their archaic comlog capable of transmitting on the tightbeam the ship was holding on them. There is even a visual display—the fuzzy holographic image of two burned and sooty faces float above the main monitor.</p>
<p class="indent">Corporal Kee looks at de Soya. “Well I’ll be damned, Father.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Me too,” says de Soya. To the waiting faces he says, “I am Father Captain de Soya on the Pax ship <em>Raphael.…”</em></p>
<p class="indent">“I remember you,” says the girl. De Soya realizes that the ship is transmitting holo images and that they can see him—no doubt a miniature ghostly face above a Roman collar, all floating above the comlog on the man’s wrist.</p>
<p class="indent">“I remember you, too,” is all de Soya can think to say. It has been a long search. He looks at the dark eyes and pale skin beneath the soot and superficial burns. So close …</p>
<p class="indent">The image of Raul Endymion speaks. “Who was that? <em>What</em> was that?”</p>
<p class="indent">Father Captain de Soya shakes his head. “I don’t know. Her name was Rhadamanth Nemes. She was assigned to us just a few days ago. She said that she was part of a new Legion they are training—” He stops. All of this is classified. He is speaking <a id="page543"/>to the enemy. De Soya looks at Corporal Kee. In the other man’s slight smile, he sees their situation. They are condemned men anyway. “She said she was part of a new Legion of Pax warriors,” he continues, “but I don’t think that was the truth. I don’t think she was human.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Amen,” says the image of Raul Endymion. The face looks away from the comlog for a minute and then returns. “Our friend is dying, Father Captain de Soya. Can you do anything to help?”</p>
<p class="indent">The priest-captain shakes his head. “We can’t get to you. The Nemes creature took our dropship and overrode the remote autopilot. We can’t even get the beacon to respond. But if you can get to it, it has an autosurgeon.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Where is it?” says the girl.</p>
<p class="indent">Corporal Kee leans into the imaging field. “Our radar shows it to be about a klick and a half southeast of you,” he says. “In the hills. It has some camouflage crap on it, but you’ll be able to find it. We’ll lead you there.”</p>
<p class="indent">Raul Endymion says, “It was <em>your</em> voice on the comlog. Telling us to get to the rocks.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, yeah,” says Kee. “We had everything diverted into the ship’s tactical fire-control system—that was about eighty gigawatts that we could deliver through atmosphere—but the groundwater would have turned to steam and killed all of you. The rocks seemed the best bet.”</p>
<p class="indent">“She beat us there,” says Raul with a crooked smile.</p>
<p class="indent">“That was the idea,” responds Corporal Kee.</p>
<p class="indent">“Thank you,” says Aenea.</p>
<p class="indent">Kee nods, embarrassed, and ducks out of the imaging field. “As the good corporal said,” continues Father Captain de Soya, “we will help guide you to the dropship.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why?” says the blurred image of Raul. “And why did you kill your own creature?”</p>
<p class="indent">De Soya shakes his head. “She was not my creature.”</p>
<p class="indent">“The Church’s, then,” insists Raul. “Why?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I hope she was not the Church’s creature,” de Soya says quietly. “If she was, then my Church has become the monster.”</p>
<p class="indent">There is a silencer broken only by the hiss of the tightbeam. “You’d better get moving,” de Soya says at last. “It is getting dark.”</p>
<p class="indent">Both faces in the holo look around them almost comically, as if they have forgotten their surroundings. “Yeah,” says Raul, <a id="page544"/>“and your lance or CPB or whatever it was melted my hand-lamp to slag.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I could light your way,” says de Soya without smiling, “but it would mean activating the main weapons system again.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Never mind,” says Raul. “We’ll manage. I’m shutting down the imager, but I’ll keep the audio channel open until we get to the dropship.”</p>
